								<h2><b>AI + Automation gives Security</b></h2>
							</div>
							<div class="blog-desc">							
								<p>Cybercriminals are always evolving their efforts and coming up with more advanced ways to target their victims. And while there are many tools available to stop them, there is a lot of space for improvement. Especially if you take automation into account.</p>

								<p>The cybersecurity abilities deficiency continues to plague organizations across sectors, markets and sectors, and the government sector is no exception. According to (ISC)2, there are only enough cybersecurity pros to fill about 60% of the jobs that are currently open -- which means the workforce will need to grow by roughly 145% to just meet the current global demand.</p>

								<h3><b>How AI and automation can help</b></h3>
								<p>The keys to producing a unified platform operation are AI and automation technologies. Because organizations cannot keep pace with the growing volume of threats by manual detection and response, they need to leverage AI/ML and automation to fill these gaps. AI-driven solutions can learn what normal behaviour looks like in order to detect anomalous behaviour.<br> For instance, many employees typically access a specific kind of data or only log on at certain times. If an employee’s account starts to show activity outside of these normal parameters, an AI/ML-based solution can detect these anomalies and can inspect or quarantine the affected device or user account until it is determined to be safe or mitigating action can be taken</p>
								<p>If the device is infected with malware or is otherwise acting maliciously, that AI-based tool can also issue automated responses. Making these tactical tasks the responsibility of AI-driven solutions frees security teams to work on more strategic problems, develop threat intelligence or focus on more difficult tasks such as detecting unknown threats</p>
								<p>IT pulls at government agencies that want to achieve AI and automation must be sure the solution they decide can scale and move at machine speeds to keep up with the increasing complexity and rate of the threat. In selecting a solution, IT managers must take time to ensure solutions have been developed using AI best practices and training techniques and that they are powered by best-in-class threat intelligence, security research and analytics technology. Data should be collected from a variety of nodes -- both globally and within the local IT environment -- to glean the most accurate and actionable information for supporting a security strategy.</p>

								<h3><b>Automating mundane cybersecurity processes</b></h3>
								<p>Several tools exist to satisfy the security needs of businesses. For example, most companies ask their employees to use virtual private networks (VPNs). </p>
								<p>A tool like that makes sure outsiders can’t intercept any data user is transferring over the network.) And while that covers the data in transfer, there’s still a risk employee will fall for phishing emails or install ransomware by accident.</p>
								<p>Security researchers cannot follow up with the threat warning notification overload. And many of these notifications are usually false. But you can’t ignore them. Criminals know how to hide in all that noise. It makes threat classification a monumental responsibility for security control teams.</p>
								<p>Therefore, providing data security professionals with automated tools is necessary. It lets them focus their skills in areas where they’re most needed. The mundane everyday tasks take up so much of technicians’ time.</p>
								<p>But automation tools are capable of handling them. It frees time for more valuable tasks that need a human touch. For instance, threat hunting and attribution.</p>
								<p>To allow the cybersecurity in today’s age, a number of masters tend to refer to the tools similar to security automation and orchestration (SOAR) products, robotic process automation (RPA) and custom-developed software plus code that automate processes and perform analysis.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, RPA tools have seen a meaningful acceleration in adoption in the HR and banking fields but can also be leveraged by cybersecurity teams. According to Forbes, custom-developed software and code can automate all manner of analyses and is often leveraged for a niche or specific challenge within an organization that may not have an out of the box tool available.</p>
