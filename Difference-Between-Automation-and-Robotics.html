								<p>The global business climate is changing very fast. Advanced technologies have been playing tremendous performances in reshaping and redefining traditional thoughts. Thus, it has become extremely important to know each new technical term in-depth.</p>

								<p>The basic difference between automation and robotics can be seen in their definitions: Let us know the differences between automation and robotics through the following points:</p>
								<p><b>Automation</b></p>

								<blockquote class="default">
									Automation-" Automation means using computer software, machines or other technology to carry out a job which would otherwise be done by an individual worker. There are several types of automation, ranging from the fully mechanical to the fully virtual, and from the very simple to the extremely complex."
								</blockquote>
								<p><b>Software Automation</b></p>

								<blockquote class="default">
									"Most of the data on automation that you can find online is about software automation. This involves using software to carry out jobs which humans usually do when they are working with computer programs."
								</blockquote>
								<p>For example, GUI test automation is a method to test computer programs. It involves copying the actions of individuals while they are using a graphical user interface. These actions are then replayed to autonomously test the application after changes have been made to the underlying software.</p>

								<p><b>Robotics</b></p>
								<blockquote class="default">
									Robotics-"Robotics is a division of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the study, planning, method, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. Robots are mechanical machines which have instruments, sensors and controllers. You program them to play physical tasks (e.g. lifting, painting, etc) and they carry out those tasks autonomously."
								</blockquote>

								<p><b>Difference#1</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Automation is a general concept for work done by advanced Information Technology and tools.</li>
									<li>Robotics is an excellent form of automation that is independent or Semi-autonomous.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p><b>Difference#2</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Automation is a general term used for specific purpose machines or systems that are designed primarily to perform a specific task</li>
									<li>Robotics (in terms of Robotics) is just a piece of machinery that can perform a variety of jobs efficiently with programming.</li>
								</ul>

								<p><b>Difference#3</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Automation often requires static and expected states to work.</li>
									<li>Robotics implies an existence that can deal with certain real-world situations of its own.</li>
								</ul>

								<p><b>Difference#4</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Automation is the regular use of largely automatic equipment in a system of production.</li>
									<li>Robotics is the branch of superior technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and administration of robots which are individually designed in accordance with the purpose.</li>
								</ul>

								<p><b>Does My Company Need Automation or Robotics?</b></p>
								<p>If you are working in a special growth company, you are probably wondering if automation or robotics could be right for your business and if yes, how could it be applied. The smart answer is: it actually depends on your modern business structure and its needs.</p>

								<p><b>In order to establish if it’s the right thing for you to consider the following:</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Are any tasks in your company currently done by human workers and are repetitive, follow the same process logic and are tedious?</li>
									<li>Are they physical duties or virtual tasks?</li>
									<li>Are any jobs in your business a bottleneck to productivity?</li>
								</ul>

								<p>If you can think of even one or two jobs which are constant, monotonous or cause a bottleneck, they may be a suitable candidate for industrialisation. If they are virtual tasks, a maker of software automation should be considered. If they are physical tasks, manufacturing automation or robotics could be the answer.</p>

								<p><b>Robots That Are No Automation</b></p>
								<p>Some robots are "autonomous" (means that they operate without humans directly controlling them) but they are not implemented in automation. For example, a toy line-following robot can autonomously track a line painted on the area. However, it is not "automation" because it isn't performing a particular task. instead, the line-following robot was transporting medicines around a hospital, then it would be automation.</p>
