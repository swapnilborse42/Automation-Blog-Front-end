								<h2><b>What effect does automation have on the economy?</b></h2>
							</div>
							<div class="blog-desc">							
								<p>The automation of tasks is already happening presently and the automation of jobs will not end until all human jobs are permanently gone.</p>
								<p>The automation of operations cannot be held as automation is the most profitable activity on the planet and the job of automating other works will be the last job position.</p>
								<p>Automation is a big matter as long as we take the fact that automation killing all jobs is only a matter of if not if.</p>
								<p>Works that are decently returned, likely, rule-based and repetitive are most vulnerable to be automated in the near term as they have the highest return on investment.</p>
								<p>Strategies for Shared Prosperity outlines a program to address automation’s challenges and possibilities. Success is possible, though it requires an all-of-the-above approach, of targeted interventions to these with the systems-level impact of smaller place-based policies to reforms to national-level human safety net plans. While automation is one of the financial challenges facing American workers, potential solutions can address multiple problems including wage stagnation and earnings inequality.</p>

								<p>Technology means no the destiny-the influence of innovation on the American worker is mediated by policy choices and how institutions, such as employers, worker organizations, non-profits, and philanthropies respond to these challenges. Through supporting workers take help of new opportunities and assisting workers who are severely impacted by automation results to stable work, we can promote greater possibility and broadly shared prosperity for each.</p>

								<p>There exists including credit to be fewer well-paying jobs and rising wealth inequality as real GDP extension occurs with decreasing employment as the rate of worker richness increases exceeds the underlying rates of job and GDP growth.</p>
								<p>The modern economic structure of exponentially growing worker productivity creates rising wealth inequality as ever lower, ever more capable smart automated machines continue to inevitably replace the majority of low and average skill workers.</p>
								<p>The bulk of remaining jobs are lower-paying assistance jobs which may keep unemployment briefly low but only increases the problem of rising wealth inequality and underemployment.</p>
								<p>Capital Investment explores the highest Interest on investment. The highest return on investment is achieved by investing in ever cheaper, ever more capable intelligent automated machines as opposed to creating jobs for ever more expensive humans. As time moves human workers have rising costs whereas these intelligent automated machines that follow them have decreasing costs.</p>
								<p>True, new jobs generated by product innovation may be offset by a “substitution effect,” as the completion of a new product causes the labour employed in producing an old one to become repetitive. However, the biggest difficulty comes from process innovation, because this only ever displaces jobs, and does not create new ones. Wherever method innovation is strong, particularly compensatory mechanisms can help to prevent rising unemployment, or whatever the British economist David Ricardo called the “redundancy” of the population.</p>
								<p>There are various such tools. First, enhanced profits will lead to further investment in modern technology, and from new products. Within addition, competition between firms will lead to a general reduction in prices, increasing demand for products and hence labour. Finally, the decrease in wages caused by initial technological unemployment will improve demand for labour and induce a shift back to more labour-intensive methods of production, soaking up the redundant workers.</p>
								<p>How fast these compensation mechanisms operate will depend on how readily capital and labour move between occupations and regions. The introduction of labour-saving technology will result in lower prices, though it will also reduce consumption by workers who are made redundant. This is then a mystery of which effect is faster. Professionals argue that the fall in the request for goods resulting from unemployment will precede, and thus dominate, the reduction in prices resulting from automation. That will point to a further improvement in joblessness, at most limited in the short run.</p>
								<p>What is occurring, and will occur, is a huge deflationary continuous event both in terms of human wages and produced economic goods and services. Ironically one smallest wage, or even worse, a rising minimum wage, will ensure that the vast majority of human workers will lose at a faster rate as the intelligent automatic movement becomes ever cheaper while the human worker becomes more costly.</p>
