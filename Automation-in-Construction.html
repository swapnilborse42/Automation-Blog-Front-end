								<h2><b>Automation in Construction</b></h2>
							</div>
							<div class="blog-desc">							
								<p>The construction business’s contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) in developing countries like that of in India is about 10%. Under the Make in India scheme, it is assumed that $1000 Billion expenses for infrastructure sector would be accomplished in the next few years. Now the construction industry is one of the most unpracticed areas in terms of automation. The importance of construction automation has grown quickly in developed countries. In developing countries like India, the construction industries require automation technologies such as new types of machinery, computerised devices, the automation of road, subway, and bridge building, etc.</p>

								<p>In times construction task is conducted under unsafe condition and situation, thus there is a need for robotics to optimize equipment development improve safety and quality of business. Automated construction method leads to a continuous working time throughout time. For speedy construction including less risk and good quality, there should be added and more spread use of machines as well as equipment in the construction application. Individual efforts and risks are decreased by using machines, robots, etc. at appropriate places. Since India has the second-largest manpower in the world, automation is not replacements of the individual-power but is an important supplement that caters to the need of mega-construction and fast-track construction.</p>
								<p> Nowadays, in India, human power is replaced by new technologies of automation because of unskilled labours, because they do not give good quality work in comparison to automation. Automation increases the productivity of the development project, reduces the duration and hard work, and improves construction safety, increases the quality of work as compared to unskilled operators.</p>
								<p>The primary study activities of the automation in the construction industry are divided accordingly to requests into two large groups that are civil infrastructure and house building. Common civil infrastructure robot applications are the automation of road, tunnel and bridge building, barrier, etc. In the house building, main applications include building skeleton erection and assembly, concrete compaction, interior finishing, etc.</p>

								<h3><b>Advantages of automation in construction</b></h3>
								<p>Automation in the construction industry may achieve the following advantages:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Replacing individuals in tasks given in dangerous environments such as those with hills, over a river etc.</li>
									<li>Returning human operators in tasks that involve hard physical or monotonous work.</li>
									<li>Uniform tone with higher efficiency than that provided by skilled workers.</li>
									<li>Making jobs that are beyond human capabilities easier.</li>
									<li>Improving productivity and operate efficiently with reduced costs.</li>
									<li>Financial development: Automation can catalyze change in the economies of enterprises or society. For instance, the gross national income and standard of living in Germany and Japan increased drastically in the 20th century, due in great part to embracing automation in construction and infrastructural development.</li>
									<li>Improving business environment as traditional manual work is reduced to a minimum, so the operators are relieved from difficult work positions.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><b>Disadvantages of automation in construction</b></h3>
								<p>Automation in the construction industry have the following disadvantages:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Construction Automation has several drawbacks like, the low property of the final product, lack of skilled labours, the safety of labour, poor weather situation, and short construction period which now are features of the project.</li>
									<li>Robots can improve the unemployment rate, So, human labour is no longer required in many production plants, They can handle their appointed tasks, but they cannot handle unpredicted situations, If the robots do all the work, the humans will sit and monitor them, health hazards will grow rapidly, Obesity will be on top of the list.</li>
									<li>If you want to install automated plant, You will need a large amount of money, You will experience from high expenses, if your operation relies on too many robots, Robots are not as intelligent as people, They can’t improve their jobs outside the pre-defined programming because they simply cannot think for themselves.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3><b>Areas of automation in Construction</b></h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Ports</li>
									<li>Factories and industries</li>
									<li>Buildings construction</li>
									<li>Roads & Runways construction</li>
									<li>Tunnels</li>
									<li>Tunnels</li>
								</ul>
