								<p>Automation or Labor-saving technology is a technology by which a method or scheme is implemented with minimal individual help. According to my point of view, this question has two aspects; one the meaning of the term “automation” second it may discuss the idea following the automation. I would like to write in a short detailed answer:</p>
								<p>First, automation implies to dynamically complete a task with the help of a system.</p>
								<p>Second, the idea talks about controlling a physical marketing process automatically. It is a very famous term nowadays and used mainly in huge businesses to manage their business processes. It progresses productivity and improves the control of a business. It is connected to a cloud-based system, BPM ( Business Process Management).</p>
								<p>Automation - Greek word “Auto”(self), “Matos”(moving).</p>
								<p>In an industrial context, automation can be defined as a technology that is concerned with the use of mechanical, electrical/electronic, and computer-based systems to control the production process.</p>
								<p>Automation is widely applied. In fact, there are several automatic processes that you are already quite familiar with. Think of automated thermostats that self-regulate a particularized temperature, or cruise control. Identifying instances of automation isn’t quite as important as understanding their wide categorization: Fixed, Programmable, and Flexible. Let’s explore the three central types of automation.</p>
								
							<!-- 	<blockquote class="default">
									Nulla nunc dui, tristique in semper vel, congue sed ligula. Nam dolor ligula, faucibus id sodales in, auctor fringilla libero. Pellentesque pellentesque eget tempor tellus. Fusce lacinia tempor malesuada. Ut lacus sapien, placerat a ornare nec, elementum sit amet felis. Maecenas pretium lorem hendrerit eros sagittis fermentum.
								</blockquote> -->
								
								<h3><b>1. Fixed Automation</b></h3>
								<p>It is also known as Hard Automation, Fixed Automation involves the employment of specific-purpose tools to automate a repeated sequence of assignments, processing, or machine operations. Generally, the operational sequence is not complex, includes fundamental functionalities like rotational or clear linear motion, or an amalgamation of both. 
								</p><p>The advantages of fixed automation are an increased rate of reproduction, low cost of the unit, and the automation of the material handling method. If the automation repeats the same tasks with the same units, it is Fixed Automation. The most well-known limitation, here, is that Hard Automation units must be replaced when new assignments need to be completed.</p>
								<h3><b>2. Programmable Automation</b></h3>
								<p>Programmable Automation provides for fresh programs to be designed and deployed to the system to implement new methods. Both traditional thermostats and traditional cruise control are instances of programmable automation — you set rate or temperature and the mechanisms consistently provide the programmed outcome. Whereas with fixed automation, automation is designed with only one collection of operation sequences, Programmable Automation allows for reprogramming for different tasks after a batch of one type is complete. 
								</p><p>The main advantage of programmable automation is greater flexibility to deal with a variety of patterns. While it is the top-fit for batch production of different designs, it produces fewer units than both Fixed and Flexible Automation because of the changeover-time between functions.</p>
								<h3><b>3. Flexible Automation</b></h3>
								<p>This automation type is an extension of programmable automation that has the ability to produce a spectrum of products with next-to-zero downtime and no complicated change-over manual method, which means greater production speed. Because there is no need for complicated reprogramming, Flexible Automation can switch between assignments. Think to our thermostat and cruise control examples. Modern adaptive cruise handle and self-learning thermostats are examples of Flexible Automation — users don’t need to reprogram the mechanisms to change their results. 
								</p><p>In manufacturing, because there is no requirement for batch production, tasks can be completed on demand. Flexible Automation enables automatic and fast changes to programmed sequences, such as the production of design variations, with virtually no down-time. In short, Flexible Automation allows for types of procedure outcomes and high production..</p><br><br>
								<h2><b>Advantages and Disadvantages</b></h2>
								<p>Advantages commonly attributed to automation involve more production speeds and improved productivity, more efficient use of materials, better result quality, upgraded security, lower workweeks for labor, and reduced factory lead times. Higher output and increased productivity have been two of the most important reasons for justifying the use of automation. Despite the claims of high quality from excellent workmanship by humans, automated systems typically perform the manufacturing process with fewer variability than human workers, resulting in greater control and consistency of result quality. Also, improved process control makes extra efficient use of materials, resulting in less scrap.</p>
								<p>Worker safety is an important reason for automating an industrial process. Automated systems often remove workers from the workplace, thus safeguarding them against the risks of the factory environment. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) was enacted with the national purpose of making work safer and protecting the physical well-being of the operator. OSHA has had the effect of increasing the use of automation and robotics in the factory</p>
								<p>Finally, the time required to process a typical production order through the factory is usually reduced with automation.</p>
								<p>The main disadvantage often associated with automation, worker displacement, has been discussed before. Despite the social advantages that might happen from retraining displaced workers for other jobs, in almost all cases the worker whose job has been taken over by a machine undergoes a period of emotional stress. In addition to displacement from work, the operator may be displaced geographically. In order to find other work, an individual may have to relocate, which is another cause of stress.</p>
								<p>Other disadvantages of automated equipment cover the high capital investment required to invest in automation (an automated system can cost millions of dollars to design, fabricate, and install), a higher level of maintenance needed than with a manually operated device, and a generally lower degree of flexibility in terms of the possible products as compared with a hand-operated system.</p>
