								<h2><b>Covid19 positive impact on automation</b></h2>
							</div>
							<div class="blog-desc">							
								<p>If the need of workforce was a problem in the past, how are companies coping among it now? As the impact of the virus continues to grow, companies are compelled to close doors and send workers home to avoid contamination. This raises the question: How and when will companies continue to run? At this critical stage, many manufacturers have realized the importance of smart automation. It is now a reality that automation has not been considered seriously as it should have.</p>

								<p>In the earlier several years, as automation saw increased adoption, questions around safety and quality were the main drivers for robotic cell implementation on factory floors. It is sad to think that a situation like this had to happen for robots to earn the reliability it deserves. The fact of the matter is that robots should never be the principal reason behind layoffs. Preferably, robots create an opportunity to help people develop higher skills at work.</p>
								<p>More and more, automation will put business owners to include new technologies, and accept technological change. Additionally, the hope is that operators will also understand that human decision-making skills won’t be compromised by robots.</p>
								<p>Sharp trends were visible in the global automation space right up to the appearance of COVID-19.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>A growing shift to software and software-as-a-service (SaaS) models: The working model of global automation suppliers is more resembling a software business. The software lies at the centre of all emerging technologies, has pushed automation suppliers to adopt the managed services and SaaS models, where industrial firms subscribe to digital services while returning an annual subscription. Users pay based on the automation provider’s promise to generate the desired outcome such as cost savings through predictive maintenance of industrial components.</li>
									<li>industrial systems and elements: Digital change has given birth to a new family of industrial parts and components which are also dependent on virtualization (augmented reality/virtual reality) and turns technology (smart devices, IIoT), as well as advanced networking support.</li>
									<li>A principal focus on cybersecurity: Increasing connection on software, the Internet and the cloud is bringing into focus the need to develop a robust cybersecurity system for modern players. This has opened up an area of specialization for automation suppliers, which revolves about cybersecurity and health, security and environment (HSE).</li>
									


								</ul>
								<p>This global crisis has pushed organisations to innovate like never previously. Administrators who may have been slow to adopt automation technologies—such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML)—have started leveraging them as a way to cut costs during economic turmoil, provider more lasting service to customers, and revamp their operations for distributed work.</p>
									<p>The automation task done now will pave the way for a safer future tomorrow. We’re seeing hospitals quickly implement new technology to better support their personnel, governments streamlining their unemployment systems to care for their citizens, and banks processing small business loans in record time.</p>
									<p>Hospitals leverage automated systems to help nurses refocus energy and time</p>
									<p>This crisis has opened our eyes to the incapability in healthcare systems around the globe. The next future will place a lot of stress on implementing variations that optimize healthcare to better serve victims and respond to need. One of the most lasting and most important optimizations we can make right now is giving time back to our healthcare specialists. On ordinary, nurses spend 7.3 hours per week on paperwork, and this number will only go up as more patients are added to their care.</p>
									<p>Additionally, many healthcare operations face a shortage of nurses to deal with this surge of new cases. So, while governments hurry to recruit new medical staff, many hospitals are leveraging automation to ensure nurses spend more time caretaking, and less of their shifts doing constant administrative tasks, such as updating records.</p>
									<p>The United Nations International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that quarantine measures affect almost 2.7 billion workers worldwide, and report that an expected 195 million jobs will be lost due to COVID-19. In the United States alone, unemployment applications have reached nearly 17 million and continue to climb.</p>
									<p>The speed and accuracy with which governments process unemployment applications will have major impacts on what savings look like behind the pandemic.</p>
									<p>The latest report from ILO states that: “Without appropriate policy measures, workers face a high risk of falling into poverty and will experience greater challenges in regaining their livelihoods during the recovery period.” Automation helps countries at all levels handle the surge of attention and provide the assistance that will keep economies and communities afloat until many markets reopen.</p>
									<p>Amid the concern over COVID-19 and its effects on the market, many patients with non-urgent, chronic medical needs face additional risk. Around the globe, medical departments have postponed all but the most urgent visits and plans. In Ireland alone, 25,000 hospital dates are cancelled every day.</p>
									<p>There is a lot of anxiety and risk in the world right now. At the same time, we’ve also seen individual ingenuity and compassion at work as somebody band together and leverage technology to fight COVID-19 as a global community. We’re seeing firsthand how digital transformation can be used to not only increase business performance but to change lives.</p>
									<p>Automation provides us with excellent tools both to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and to redefine the new normal in a post-COVID world. We’re starting to see the foundational change that will power the future of work: governments exchanging slow, manual methods for workflows that are secure and scalable, and hospitals abandoning inefficient methods to support their frontline caretakers. </p>
