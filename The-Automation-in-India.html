								<h2>The Automation in India</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="blog-desc">		

							<p>Beside speedy development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics Technology (RT), automation is revolutionising the modern world, as robots can perform a slew of duties without much human interference. AI and RT are expected to double in India in the next 3 to 5 years and every company must be ready to embrace the difference. Companies and professionals in India require the amount of change towards AI and RT from the current 14% to 30% in the next 3-5 years, higher than the Global and APAC (Asia-Pacific) average. Contrary to the popular belief, where automation would replace humans to minimise the costs, the survey observed that more than half the companies believe that automation will augment human performance, create new skill sets, etc., rather than replace it.</p>
							<p>AI is all about trying to make machines or software mimic human behaviour. AI has provided us with immense processing power, storage capacity and real-time access to information. These developments of technology gave us the spinning wheel in the first, electricity in the second, and computers in the third industrial revolution. In 2016, the World Economic Forum named AI “the fourth industrial revolution” that has radically changed the way we live, work and unite with each other. However, it has also given us the regulatory challenges, like Data Ownership, Data Security, Labour Protection, etc. AI will replace tasks, not jobs. Instead of worrying about job losses, companies must promote AI and machine learning, which takes over repetitive tasks, with no errors, without compromising the safety and quality, apart from increased productivity, efficient use of materials, etc.</p>		 <p>The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) uses smart sensors and actuators to enhance manufacturing and industrial processes. Additionally known as the Industrial Internet or Industry 4.0.</p>


							<p>IIoT leverages the ability of smart machines and real-time analytics to take advantage of the data that dumb machines have produced in industrial surroundings for years. The driving philosophy behind IIoT is that smart machines are not only better than humans at capturing and analysing the data in real-time, but they are also better at communicating important information that can be used to drive business decisions faster and more accurately. Connected sensors and actuators enable companies to pick up on inefficiencies and problems sooner, and save time and money. Specifically, in manufacturing, IIoT is great potential for quality control, sustainable and growing practices, supply chain traceability and overall supply chain capability. In an industrial setting, IIoT is important to processes such as predictive maintenance, enhanced field service, force management and asset tracking.</p>
							<p>However, with the current automation scenario in the manufacturing sector, islands of automation have created several challenges, as the lack of integration has impacted on operational improvements. While advanced countries have now started to focus on integration, the Indian manufacturing sector is still in the early stages of adoption of manufacturing solutions. While “India has the second-largest pool of scientist and engineers in the world” it looks like that the lack of adoption is due to a gap in the suitability of surviving technology to implement or adapt. In India, around 1% of manufacturing GDP comes from automation, whereas in developed economies the percentage is closer to 5%. India demands to “Go Global” and that is possible only with improved investment in automation. With the government announcing and supporting various schemes, India is already on the right path towards globalisation.</p>


							<p>There are some major areas in labour policy that require attention like reskilling workers and rethinking social policy in the short-term, as well as re-examining employment potential of new sectors. Production processes, business models, service delivery mechanisms along with employment relationships and social protection frameworks must be reconfigured.With the government announcing various schemes and incentives, “Make in India” concept will definitely take India to a higher platform.</p>
