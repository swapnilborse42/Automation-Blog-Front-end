								<p>There are many IT jobs that you simply know are made for failure. They are so big and cumbersome and in some cases are pushing through new ground that unforeseen issues are likely. Then there are other circumstances where an IT pro might just say “whoops” when that unexpected result should have been.</p>

								<h3><b>The buggy outage that dropped Dropbox from the web:</b></h3>
								<p>No IT team has the experience of an outage, particularly when it kicks off a race for your company to achieve its emergency plans. During January 2014, Dropbox found themselves struggling in this very scenario when a purposed product upgrade drove down the sites for three hours.</p>
								<p>While a “subtle bug” in the Dropbox script automatically implemented its updates to a small figure of running machines, it hit Dropbox’s thousands of production servers and caused the company’s live settings to fail. Luckily for Dropbox, its emergency procedure was well designed and most effective. Among its backup and recovery plan, the IT team was capable to restore most of its services within three hours. For some of the larger databases, however, recovery was more delayed - getting the company several days for all of its core support to fully return.</p>

								<h3><b>An Automated fleet of flightless birds</b></h3>
								<p>Extensive logistics services rely on automated methods to achieve the necessary speed to perform at scale. Any airlines struggle to keep those systems functional. Just like regular, manual processes of systems administration, automated systems suffer from misconfigurations. Under the worst-case situations from recent years, breakdown of these systems has cost airlines hundreds of millions of dollars and more in their customers’ goodwill.</p>
								<p>If misconfigurations happen, they are driven out quickly through automated mechanisms and can bring entire systems down. For airlines, this means flight operations are suspended, planes are delayed, and money is siphoned out of the company. In one such case in January 2017, Delta told investors that one glitch in their automated system generated an expansive outage, costing the shuttle more than $150 million.</p>

								<h3><b>You’ve got mail?: Gmail’s 2014 bug-induced failure</b></h3>
								<p>While technology giants feel the occasional automation-related outage, an hour of downtime can mean a lot higher. For these huge organizations to make any sort of development, they have to do so across thousands of servers. Becoming always been on the bleeding side of technology, that’s no wonder that Google has automated its configuration management. Although used to make operations easier, while the wrong change is executed in an automated system that means it can propagate far and wide inside a matter of seconds.</p>
								<p>In 2014, a bug in Google’s internal automatic configuration system caused Gmail to crash for about half an hour. This false configuration was sent to live services, causing users’ requests for their data to be neglected, for those services, in turn, to generate mistakes.</p>
								<p>The education is that configuration automation is not the same as configuration control. Automation ensures that developments get pushed out across all systems.</p>

								<h3><b>When the DynamoDB database interrupted all of Amazon’s infrastructure</b></h3>
								<p>Only as physical services like freight haulage need physical infrastructures like roads and highways, companies’ digital services depend on underlying digital support. While some of Amazon’s automated infrastructure methods timed out in September 2015, their Amazon Web Services cloud program suffered an outage. Cascading of an uncomplicated network separation into broad service crash, Amazon encountered a network outage like those traditional on-premise data centres experience, despite its very forward and integrated cloud platform</p>
								<p>Amazon had a network disruption that impacted a portion of its DynamoDB cloud database’s storage servers. When this happened, a number of storage servers simultaneously requested their membership data, exceeded their allowed retrieval and transmission time. As a consequence, the servers were incapable to obtain their membership data and subsequently removed themselves from taking requests.</p>
								<p>While the servers that converted unavailable for requests began retrying the requests, the DynamoDB timeout issue manifested itself in a broader network outage. Exactly like that, a network disruption started a vicious cycle and affecting Amazon’s customers as it took down AWS for 5 hours.</p>
