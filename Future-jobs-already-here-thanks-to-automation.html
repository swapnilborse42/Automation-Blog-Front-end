								<h2><b>Future jobs already here thanks to automation</b></h2>
							</div>
							<div class="blog-desc">							
								<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have advanced, human labour is no longer necessary for certain tasks in the workplace. While it’s a trend that worries some, tech advocates say automation will free human workers up to tackle more impactful and creative strategic projects.</p>
								<p>Here are future jobs that are already here thanks to automation</p>

								<h3><b>Automation administrator</b></h3>
								<p>Automation software runs using logical rules, not magic. It does exactly as it is told. And that means that someone needs to tell it what to do.</p>
								<p>More than that, it’s good practice to keep an eye on automation software. It’ll run until one tell it to stop, even if the process is unneeded or out of date. </p>

								<h3><b>Warehouse And Manufacturing Jobs</b></h3>
								<p>Repeatable job-based duties are likely to be the first to be automated. AI exceeds at pattern recognition, working sequenced tasks faster and with higher accuracy than human workers. Warehouse operators and other industrial-based jobs will be automated as robots will be able to move inventory with greater efficiency and with fewer safety concerns than humans.</p>
								

								<h3><b>AI trainer</b></h3>
								<p>one requires to ‘teach’ the automation tools to translate input into the desired outcome. It’s not unlike the way a dog needs training if one wants it to do something.</p>
								<p>AI trainers supervise the learning of AI. They’re responsible for training the technology with data and ensuring that the tool learns the right things. Such models, for instance, might include image recognition training, empathy training, or even worldview training.</p>

								<h3><b>Customer Service</b></h3>
								<p>Consumer assistance still has a huge potential for automation. It’s not completely uncharted territory now, but the technology just isn’t where it needs to be to keep customers from getting frustrated because they feel they’re speaking to robots who can’t understand them. It is, however, improving rapidly, and think that may be an industry that switches over entirely in the next few years.</p>
								

								<h3><b>Local TV Advertising</b></h3>
								<p>The paper-based workflow and processes used to secure advertising on local TV are automating rapidly due to industry pressures such as the growth of streaming services like Netflix and digital ads. Automated “programmatic” advertising delivers vast efficiencies and transaction transparency, freeing buyers and sellers to spend more time on improving campaign results and growing revenue.</p>
								

								<h3><b>BPA programmer</b></h3>
								<p>AI might be learning how to write code. Automation software might seem extremely able and smart. But as clever and as capable as automation tool may be, it’s not smart enough to code itself into existence. Therefore, for automation to proceed to be part of the fabric of the workplace, future jobs will have to include the role of the business process automation software programmer.</p>
								

								<h3><b>Chief listening officer</b></h3>
								<p>Chief listening officers oversee the management and monitoring of all communications about organisations. So, that includes mentions on social media, customer reviews, comments, and inbound messages.</p>
								<p>Here performance is fed by automation software, which offers 24/7/365 social listening potential. This can pull every notice, comment, post review and message for one, along with smart sentiment analysis. Therefore, someone wants to be there to reap the benefits of this insight. This is why ‘chief listening officer’ is one of the future jobs fuelled by automation.</p>

								<h3><b>Fast Food Service</b></h3>
								<p>The next decade will see total automation of front-line fast-food duty production and distribution. We are already seeing sophisticated self-service kiosks within many fast-food chains, whereby buying food is as easy as a few touches on a mobile. Several of the positions will be automated via robot-enabled artificial intelligence with maybe one or two humans to oversee the complete facility.</p>
								

								<h3><b>Any Tasks That Can Be Learned</b></h3>
								<p>In the next 10 years, jobs that can be learned will be automated. The focus for most engineers at the moment is advancing the Level of Automation (LOA) across the board to more advanced applications in industry. The way we will realize these advancements is by building systems that can learn things they need to automate on their own, and within the next 10 years, this should be the reality.</p>
