								<p>Automation in medical simply means automating tasks in the medical area.</p>
								<p>Some jobs that doctors and nurses work can be automated. Observe those blood-pressure kiosks recognise in department stores and pharmacies, as well as those self-test parts for blood sugars.</p>

								<h3><b>Displacing doctors and medical staff entirely?</b></h3>
								<p>Viewing it of the view of someone who has done Automation for a living, it would be a hugely difficult undertaking with little likelihood of progress.</p>
								<p>For instance: there are a vast amount of doctors in all classes. All have his or her own regimen of practice, required skills and knowledge base.</p>
								<p>Certainly, some elementary jobs that they do on a regular basis may fall by the wayside, though the entirety of the work is not merely a concatenation of discrete jobs-knowing which tasks to perform and in what order, and whereby best to use the information that results on a case-by-case basis, and then go forward with the most suitable treatment.</p>
								<p>IBM Watson could more considerably better patient outcomes by revolutionizing how doctors manage cancer along with different diseases. Applying deep learning, Watson can take victims’ medical knowledge, obtain important features, and make a treatment method for the patient based on the latest evidence from resources online. For instance, Watson as Oncology has been prepared by doctors at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to detect and diagnose cancer as well as to give treatment choices. More than eight out of ten times, Watson was accurate in diagnosing a patient with leukaemia.<br> Meanwhile more, to lung and rectal cancer, Watson gave the same treatment recommendation as doctors did more than ninety per cent of the time. At top of all that, IBM Watson drastically reduced screening times by 78% for many different cancers, which is doing everything faster and more effective.</p>
								<p>Here are <strong>Advantages</strong> that can be realized by using automation to healthcare:</p>

								<ol>
									<li><h3><b>Labor Savings</b></h3><p>Using automation to replace manually intensive tasks that are completely done by machine can be a big time saver. This doesn’t have to dismiss employees, though rather elevate them into higher-functioning roles that offer the use of the clinical expertise they have been prepared for.</p></li>
									<li><h3><b>Enhanced Quality and Consistency</b></h3><p>Automation tools are not subjected to human error or weakness, so they can help give a consistent basis of care projects. A Texas hospital research determined that greater automation in the sectors of medical records, order entry, and decision guide appeared to result in a reduction in deaths, complications and cost.</p></li>
									<li><h3><b>Reduced Waste</b></h3><p>Use of paper and other workarounds required for an overfull workload can lead to a lot of garbage. For instance, preferably than playing phone tag with a discharged case in the free minutes between hospital nursing services, automation can assist get nurses and patients connected further efficiently.</p></li>
									<li><h3><b>Improved Predictability of Outcomes</b></h3><p>If patients follow a regulated care path supported by automation, it is also likely they will stay on track towards predicted outcomes. Plus, automation can assist detect when a patient has deviated from the recommended care plan so the administration team can intervene.</p></li>
									<li><h3><b>Higher Throughput</b></h3><p>A nurse assisted by automation tools can handle a larger population of patients at one time. Rather of scaling up and down your headcount as patient volumes grow and shrink, an automated platform can scale flexibly to ask groups of all sizes.</p></li>
									
								</ol>

								<p>Here are some <strong>Disadvantages</strong> of automation in medical</p>
								<ol>

									<li>Staff may lack training in computerized programs. Some staff members might not be computer literate and may need extensive training in order to know how to program automated dispensing machines correctly.</li>
									<li>Administration of drugs through machines may lead to death. After surgery, many patients are given morphine drips intravenously to help reduce pain. Unfortunately, if a hospital staff member programs the wrong dose of the drug and an overdose is given, a patient can have difficulty breathing.</li>
