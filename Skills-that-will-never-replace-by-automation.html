								<!-- <h2>First Title</h2> -->
								<p>The nature of work is evolving. Automation is spurring a revolution, transforming jobs in every industry from IT to manufacturing.</p>
								<p>With time, automation has been slowly making its place in our lives. This does our work easier, effective and error-free. But, this more makes us lazy, which is quite an obvious speculation and result. The theory of automation replacing NI is not far off. Of being a far-fetched though it has turned into truth. Shortly, automation will be seen and its use felt everywhere. Also if automation makes it place permanently in our lives, automation cannot replace many things.</p>

								<p>Each action that can be broken down into easy logical steps can now be easily automated. Without these activities alone form a portion of any enterprise. Some of these activities are:</p>

								<h3><b>Education</b></h3>
								<p>Also with all the opportunities offered by on-demand educational courses, children learn social skills better when done in groups and these groups are still manages better by human teachers.</p>

								<h3><b>Arts</b></h3>
								<p>None AI or robot can even the creativity of individuals, however. Arts are areas where individuals can still excel than anything else for the foreseeable tomorrow.</p>

								<h3><b>Governance</b></h3>
								<p>No concern how excellent an AI becomes we will still want to govern ourselves. This is somewhat due to the concern of AI winning over humans.</p>

								<h3><b>Leadership quality</b></h3>
								<p>Individuals make both good and evil leads but if it were to be done by machines they would fail at the start. Because they cannot understand they can never become efficient and great leaders.</p>

								<h3><b>Judgment</b></h3>
								<p>Us all know extremely well what will result if robots or AI overrun our courts. Yes, we can use those mind-boggling technologies to facilitate analysis, fact-finding, and other trivial elements of our court system. But, they cannot replace the human touch when it comes to legal matters. robots cannot simply take the place of judges, DAs, and lawyers. And especially, automation won’t be able to copy our innate ability to tell what’s right from wrong: judgment.</p>
								<p>Fight discussion and resolution are two other skills that will remain sound in the face of AI and robotics. If you are preparing towards a law career, however, you must realize that not every position is secure. Paralegals, whose work involves hunting for and gathering relevant legal data, will definitely feel the automation heat.</p>



								<h3><b>Hospitality</b></h3>
								<p>Many of us still prefer human interaction for such services where trust is an important factor. </p>

								<h3><b>Communication Skills</b></h3>
								<p>According to Statista, an ordinary adult American consumes nearly 12 hours consuming media. This is lots of information, implying that communication skills will form an essential part of our everyday life in tomorrow. That is not to say robotics has not been applied to authorship and proliferation of information. </p>
								<p>The truth of the thing, though, is that people still prefer their news and information to be written in a compelling and sensible way. Therefore, if you are considering a career in journalism, your skills will live to see another day.</p>


								<h3><b>Athleticism and Physical Skill</b></h3>
								<p>Of time traditional, individuals have always been influenced by the utter physical skill of our minds and bodies. Athletics, for instance, is a profession that will always be recognised despite the epic speeds, dexterity, and coordination robots can deliver.</p>

								<h3><b>Planning skills</b></h3>
								<p>If we play games on the computer we sometimes miss, this is because they are defined by certain logical rules and regulations. Whereas humans can handle a situation according to their requirements, that AI cannot.</p>

								<p>Certain points were few amongst the lot. No matter how high-level AI gets, it will never be capable enough to beat the human mind. This is us, who have made AI and not the other way nearby. There have it, skills that automation won’t replace in the foreseeable future.</p>
