								<h2>Business process automation</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="blog-desc">							
								<p>Business process automation (BPA) is a procedure wherein businesses use technology to build their personnel and systems within workflows. Processes are the sets of actions that move your firm toward a goal. The studies predict that automation can cut running costs up to 90 per cent with BPA. </p>
								<blockquote class="default">
									"Business automation is automating the company process using robust software or digital process. Within business, there is still some responsibility which we tend to do by following the manual process. This manual process is time consuming, complex and is prone to human error. Within business, a stupid mistake can cause a thousand dollar, so that the idea of business automation has evolved."
								</blockquote>
								
								<p>Today, BPA is a normal part of the toolkit for method excellence and continuous development, with components similar methods integration, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and workflow tools. Among the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting objects to the digital world, BPA enables the change of data over a network without any human cooperation. Advances in mobile technology have enabled a remote workforce, which can dramatically decrease company expenses.</p>
								<p>The Elements of Business Process Automation</p>

								<p>Most BPA efforts involve three elements:</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Business rules and logic</li>
									<li>Structured data</li>
									<li>Unstructured data</li>

								</ul>
								<p>Business rules and logic include the stipulations, reasons, data, and documents that support your business parameters. Some of this logic may be fully automated, while other portions may need to be reviewed by someone involved in the process.</p>
								<p>Structured data is the information in your enterprise applications that you reference when making process updates. This data is highly organized and easily detectable by search engine algorithms, as it appears in fixed fields within your records or files. Machines can generate structured data (such as manufacturing sensors that produce the temperature of rotation count), and so can humans (such as those filling out the age, gender, or ZIP code fields of a form).</p>

								<p>While unstructured data is more subjective and usually quite text heavy, it is extremely important, as most information used to make business decisions is unstructured. This data can come from many sources (for example, social media) and is difficult to put into a structured format of columns and rows for easy extraction and analysis. BPA platforms aim to seamlessly integrate these three elements.</p>
								<h3><b>How does it work</b></h3>
								<p>Business automation just automates the business operation and bring efficiency in the manner. For instance, think about visitor administration process. In a manual operation, a visitor has to write down there all aspects in a paper book, it covers but not limited to - Name, address, phone number, the purpose of the meeting, hostname, etc. Addressing all these details required time and sometimes become annoying when one has to write the same thing each time they attend the office. On the other hand, there is no such way of checking the authenticity of the information.</p>
								<p>While this job is automated by a visitor management system here is how the whole scenario turns</p>
								<ol>
									<li>The system eliminates the hassle of writing the same information again and again. The visitor only asked to give information at their first visit and the system record their information. So whenever the visitor will visit the place the system can recognize them</li>
									<li>This streamlines the check-in process</li>
									<li>When visitor finish check-in the system sends a notification to the host</li>
									<li>Host meet the visitor</li>
								</ol>

								<h3><b>Pro:</b></h3>
								<ul>
									<li><h3> Efficiency</h3><p>A major benefit to implementing more automated processes within a business is that it can eliminate the most time-consuming, repetitive tasks to free up employees’ time for more important undertakings. Self-service portals concerning employees’ HR-related requirements, automated database researches, and general document management are instances of business processes that can be automated to assist cut down on the time that would otherwise be spent manually formulating them.</p></li>
									<li><h3>Reliability</h3><p>Automating jobs that normally require important manual input can ensure more increased accuracy and eliminate the possibility of human error. Businesses can count on more extra precision when it comes to in-depth reports, compliance with internal or external requirements, time tracking, order filling, etc.</p></li>
									
								</ul>
								<h3><b>Con:</b></h3>
								<ul>
									<li><h3>Job Uncertainty</h3><p>Perhaps the biggest concern for both business owners and employees is "automated business processes eventually eliminate certain jobs?" As several positions that involve repeated, system-based jobs, the answer may imply “yes.” On the other view, the need for automated business systems advances to grow, people will be required to create them, which will in itself create new employment.</p></li>
									<li><h3>Lack of human touch</h3><p>No concern the company or industry, quality client service will always be power. At the result of the day, human connection and individual ideas generated by people will be what grows businesses forward to a successful tomorrow</p></li>
									
								</ul>
