								<p>The terms ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘automation’ are usually used interchangeably. They’re shorthand for ‘robots’ and other machines that allow us to operate further efficiently and productively -whether it’s a mechanical construct piecing together a car, either you understand not perishing in a fire because the smog alarm went off.</p>
								<p>But there are some moderately big differences between automated systems and AI.</p>
								<h2><b>Automation:</b></h2>

								<p>"Automation or Labor-saving technology is a technology by which a method or scheme is implemented with minimal individual help. According to my point of view, this question has two aspects; one the meaning of the term “automation” second it may discuss the idea following the automation. I would like to write in a short detailed answer:"</p>
								<p>First, automation implies to dynamically complete a task with the help of a system.</p>
								<p>Second, the idea talks about controlling a physical marketing process automatically. It is a very famous term nowadays and used mainly in huge businesses to manage their business processes. It progresses productivity and improves the control of a business. It is connected to a cloud-based system, BPM ( Business Process Management). </p>
								<p>Automation - Greek word “Auto”(self), “Matos”(moving).</p>
								<p>In an industrial context, automation can be defined as a technology that is concerned with the use of mechanical, electrical/electronic, and computer-based systems to control the production process.</p>

								<h2><b>Artificial Intelligence:</b></h2>
								<p>let's Divide it to understand,</p>
								<p>Artificial:  produced by individual beings rather than happening naturally, especially as a copy of something natural</p>
								<p>Intelligence: the capacity to acquire and apply knowledge and abilities.</p>
								<p>So basically in Artificial Intelligence, we create some kind of Machine in which we calculate the “Ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills”.</p>
								<p>So using this knowledge it learns by previous experiences that means we do not need to program each and every instruction also we use either Data or we reward the machine whenever it makes the amazing task that we want it to do. Moreover day by day it learns the task we want it to do.</p>
								<p>Let’s go a bit deeper,</p>
								<p>Our mind can do five basic tasks,</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Classify things (this is red that is blue)</li>
									<li>Predict (if I will invest in this company I may get good returns)</li>
									<li>Cluster (this friendship group is not good for me to let’s move to some other)</li>
									<li>Recommend (hey, you should read this book or this video or this game)</li>
									<li>Decision Making (I won’t go out today as there are some violence going on in the city)</li>
									
								</ul>								
							

								<p>We all know that humans are intelligent species and this is because the human mind can do these five above tasks.</p>
								<p>So if we give a machine an ability to do these five tasks then it will be called an Artificially Intelligent Machine</p>
								<h2><b>Artificial Intelligence In Automation</b></h2>
								<p>Accelerating AI abilities will enable automation of some tasks that have long required individual labour. These changes will open up new opportunities for individuals, the market, and society, but they will also disrupt the current livelihoods of millions of Americans. The new study examines the expected result of AI-driven automation on the economy and describes broad strategies that could improve the benefits of AI and mitigate its costs.</p>
								<p>AI-driven automation will change the economy over the coming times and decades. The call for policymakers will be to update, strengthen, and adapt policies to respond to the economic effects of AI.</p>
								<p>There is much uncertainty about how strongly these results will be felt and how rapidly they will arrive. It is possible that AI will not have great, new effects on the economy, such that the coming times are subject to the same basic workforce trends seen in a modern decade- any of which are actual, and others which are worrisome and may require policy adjustments. At the other end of the range of occasions, the economy might encounter a larger shock, with accelerating changes in the job shop, and significantly more workers in demand of assistance and retraining as their skills no longer match the demands of the job market. Given the available evidence, it is not possible to make specific predictions, so policymakers need to be prepared for a range of potential outcomes. At a point, some occupations such as drivers and cashiers are likely to face displacement from or a restructuring of their current employment.</p>
