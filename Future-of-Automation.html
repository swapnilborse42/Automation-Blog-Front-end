								<p>Nowadays we can see that day by day productivity has been improved and every day we need everything and product as soon as active with the best quality and cheapest prices. So manual production or work is not capable to make these much of return with more excellent quality and low cost.</p>

								<p>Each industrial sector like construction, process industries, chemical, food & beverages, Oil Gas, Transport, machine tools everywhere Industrial automation is applied. It will increase productivity, safety, reliability</p>
								<p>Artificial intelligence, IoT, Machine Learning also nowadays integrated with PLC SCADA. PLC SCADA is used for Controlling and monitoring systems with logical programming.</p>
								<p>In each industry, we need automation methods, so here we have a list of industries where automation is used.</p>
								<ol>
								  <li>Oil and Gas Sector</li>
								  <li>Machine Tools</li>
								  <li>Manufacturing Industries</li>
								  <li>Power Plant</li>
								  <li>Chemical and Pharma</li>
								  <li>Process Industries</li>
								  <li>Food Industries</li>
								  <li>Automobile Industries</li>
								  <li>Irrigation Systems</li>
								  <li>Engineering Services</li>
								</ol>

								<p>The oil and gas industry has been extremely automated for decades. Companies have completely automated systems at plant locations (refineries, chemical plants, gas plants, offshore platforms, gathering centers, and stabilization centers, etc.) that are continuously observed such that human intervention can happen in certain situations if needed.</p>
								<p>Portions of the oil and gas industry that still have a large percentage of non-automated work include well drilling, well completion; well workovers; shipping, and trucking. Due to the highly individualized nature of these currently non-automated projects, they will likely continue to be non-automated for the foreseeable future</p>
								<p>Though industrial automation has been studied, with claims that it will lead to mass unemployment, its future is very clear. Industrial engineers are focusing on improving the modern industrial robots to provide future robots that can multi-purpose. This way, one machine can execute different modern duties. Further, industrial robots are projected to have more abilities, like human workers, such as the ability to make choices and to operate autonomously. They will also feature predictive maintenance and self-diagnostic abilities. Advancement in manufacturing industrial automation means that future companies will be quite effective in the utilization of raw supplies, individual resources, and above all.</p>
								<p>With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics technology, automation is at a tipping position. Today, robots can complete a slew of functions without a considerable human interaction. Automated technologies are not only executing iterative tasks but also growing workforce skills significantly.</p>
								<p>In fact, automated machines are expected to replace about half of the global workforce. Multiple industries, from manufacturing to banking, are using automation to drive productivity, security, profitability, and quality.</p>
								<p>Automation will support connectivity and safety in a hyper-competitive ecosystem. The future of automation looks promising where everything will be made available and easily available. HCL’s COPA, powered by DRYiCETM, transcends traditional automation technology by performing a comprehensive suite of integrated robotic process automation for the beginning, mid, and final-office parts of a process.</p>
								<p><strong>Here are a few key sections that many experts recognize on with respect to the future age of automation:</strong></p>
								<h3>Half of the manufacturing hours achieved today are spent on manual jobs</h3>
								<ul>
								  <li>In a study of North American and European construction jobs, it was observed that roughly 48% of hours primarily relied on the use of standard or physical labor.</li>
								  <li>By the year 2030, it’s predicted that only 35% of the time will be used on such routine work.</li>
								  
								</ul> 

								<h3>Automation’s impact will be considered by the mid-2020s.</h3>
								<ul>
								  <li>According to a current statement from PwC, the impact on OECD jobs will start to be felt in the mid-2020s</li>
								  <li>At 2025, for example, it’s prophesied that 10-15% of jobs in sectors (production, transport and warehouse, and wholesales and retail trade) will have a great potential for automation.</li>
								  <li>By 2035, the range of jobs with high automation potential will be more like 35-50% for those sectors.</li>
								</ul> 

								<h3>Industrial robot prices are reducing.</h3>
								<ul>
								  <li>Industrial robot purchases are sky-high, mainly the result of falling production costs.</li>
								  <li>This trend is expected to proceed, with the price of robots falling by 65% between 2015 and 2025.</li>
								  <li>With the cost of labor usually rising, this makes it more challenging to keep low-skilled jobs.</li>
								</ul> 

								<h3>Technology together creates jobs, but how many?</h3>
								<ul>
								  <li>One bright spot is that automation and AI will also generate jobs, likely in functions that are difficult for us to think of today.</li>
								  <li>Historically, technology has made more jobs than it has destroyed.</li>
								  <li>AI only is demanded to have an economic result of $15.7 trillion by 2030.</li>
								</ul>
